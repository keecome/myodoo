Private Thread and Discussions
==============================
The app is a tool to communicate with colleagues without interrupting followers.
Odoo default functionality assumes each time you send a message all subscribers (including partners) are notified.
As an alternative you may log an internal note without notifications.
This approach hardly suits in a case you would like to communicate something important only to your colleague.
This app let avoid excess emails but simultaneously notify required partners.
* Notifications are not sent to the followers disregarding their subscription
* Messages are visible for ones who may see the parent object except portal users
* In order to send such a message it is enough to flag a check box on email composer form
* You may use an app also to check system messages such as sending a quotation to a customers
* The app equally works for all objects (sales orders, invoices, issues, etc.)

- In the invoice lines:

  - **Qty UMT**: It is the quantity expressed in the unit of measure of
    customs of the product.

    It will be used for the attribute ""CantidadAduana"" in each of the
    merchandise to sell, when the Code Customs of the product UMT is
    different to 99.

    This field is automatically filled in the invoice lines in the
    following cases:

    1. The product has the same value for UMT customs and UoM.
           In this case, Qty UMT is set to the same value of the quantity of
           products on the line.

    2. The code of the unit of measurement in UMT of the product is equal to 06 (kilo).
           In this case, Qty UMT will be equal to the weight defined in the
           product multiplied by the quantity of products being sold.

    In other cases, this value must be defined by the user, in each one of the
    lines.

  - **Unit Value UMT**: Represents the unit price of the merchandise in the
    Customs UMT. It is used to set the attribute ""ValorUnitarioAduana"" in
    each of the CFDI merchandise. It is transparent to the user.

    product of the line.

- In the Company

  - **Number of Reliable Exporter**: Identification of the exporter
    according to the Article 22 of Annex 1 of the Free Trade Agreement with
    the European Association and to the Decision of the European Community,
    used to establish the attribute ""NumeroExportadorConfiable"" if the
    country of the customer belongs to the Union European

- In addition, the following models were added:

  - **Locality**:  model used to store the localities from Mexico provided
    by the SAT's catalog. Its fields are name, state, country and code.
    c_localidad_

In this version, the external trade complement does not support the Type of
Transfer Proof ('T'). For this reason, the nodes ""Propietario"" and
""MotivodeTraslado"" are not specified in the External Trade Template. On the
other hand, the optional node ""DescripcionesEspecificas"" will not be added
in this version, since it needs fields that depend on the stock module.
They will be added in a later version.
